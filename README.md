# Fashion MNIST Classification

## Introduction
This repository contains a complete implementation of Fashion MNIST classification using both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels each, representing 10 categories of fashion items. The challenge is divided into three levels of increasing complexity:

- **Level 0: Data Loading and Initial Inspection**
- **Level 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Level 2: Basic Classification Model (Logistic Regression)**
- **Level 3: Neural Network Implementation**

## Running the Notebook Locally
To run the notebook on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Download the `ipynb` notebook file from this repository.
2. Open it in your preferred Python environment (Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Google Colab, etc.).
3. Install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the notebook cell by cell.

### Alternative: Running on Google Drive
If you encounter issues running the notebook locally, you can execute it in Google Colab. The dataset is stored on Google Drive, and the link is provided below for direct access.

## Task Levels
### ðŸ‘ž Level 0: Data Loading and Initial Inspection
âœ… Load the dataset using pandas/numpy
âœ… Check the dataset shape and print it.
âœ… Display a few images using matplotlib with their labels.
âœ… Verify grayscale format by checking a single image. 

### ðŸ”° Level 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
âœ… Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
âœ… Utilize libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to load and visualize the dataset.
âœ… Display sample images from each category to understand data distribution.
âœ… Generate summary statistics for pixel values.

### âš¡ Level 2: Basic Classification Model
âœ… Develop a classifier using Logistic Regression to predict clothing categories.
âœ… Preprocess and normalize the data.
âœ… Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
âœ… Implement algorithm using a library of choice.
âœ… Train the model and evaluate accuracy and loss metrics.
âœ… Implement Explainable AI techniques to interpret model decisions.

### ðŸš€ Level 3: Neural Network Implementation
âœ… Construct and train a simple neural network to classify images.
âœ… Design a neural network architecture with input, hidden, and output layers.
âœ… Utilize appropriate activation functions.
âœ… Train the model on the training dataset and validate it on a separate validation set.
âœ… Evaluate accuracy and loss metrics.

## Additional Features
- Implemented Early Stopping for model optimization.
- Saved the trained model for future use.
- Visualized loss and accuracy trends over training epochs.
